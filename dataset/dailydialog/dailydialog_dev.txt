1	That sounds good .	neutral

0	4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .	neutral
1	Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .	neutral
0	You mean to saya	neutral
1	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?	neutral
0	We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .	neutral

0	Why is the car before us stopping ?	neutral
1	What's going on ?	neutral
0	Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .	neutral
1	More and more people easily get irritated while driving .	neutral
0	Yes . This is what is called road rage .	neutral

1	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .	neutral
0	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?	neutral
1	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .	neutral
0	The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...	neutral
1	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .	neutral
0	That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?	neutral
1	Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .	neutral

1	Sure thing .	neutral

0	What do you think of our price ?	neutral
1	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?	neutral
0	Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .	neutral
1	I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .	neutral
0	I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .	neutral
1	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .	neutral
0	I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .	neutral
1	Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?	neutral
0	We've already cut down our price to cost level .	neutral
1	Is that all ?	neutral
0	Yes , this is the best we can do .	neutral
1	I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .	neutral

0	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?	neutral

0	Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .	neutral
1	I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?	neutral
0	You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .	neutral
1	But what if I need my money suddenly ?	neutral
0	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .	neutral
1	Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !	neutral
0	Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot	neutral
1	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .	happiness

1	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .	neutral
0	Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?	neutral
1	All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .	neutral
0	Okay , that's good . I get it .	happiness

0	Kate , you never believe what's happened .	surprise
1	What do you mean ?	neutral
0	Masha and Hero are getting divorced .	neutral
1	You are kidding . What happened ?	surprise
0	Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .	neutral
1	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?	surprise
0	Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .	neutral
1	That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?	neutral
0	Early in the New Year I guess .	neutral

0	Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?	neutral
1	No . It's been empty the whole time .	neutral
0	Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .	neutral
1	I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?	neutral
0	No . My friend did .	neutral
1	Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?	neutral
0	No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .	neutral
1	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .	neutral
0	I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?	neutral
1	Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .	neutral
0	Should I call the police ?	neutral
1	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .	neutral
0	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .	neutral
1	I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .	neutral
0	Thanks for your help .	neutral

1	It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?	happiness
0	Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .	neutral

1	Not at all . Go ahead .	neutral
0	Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?	neutral
1	Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .	neutral

0	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .	neutral
1	It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .	neutral
0	You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .	neutral
1	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .	neutral
0	Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .	neutral
1	To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .	neutral

1	It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .	neutral

1	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .	neutral
0	So what can we do ?	neutral
1	Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .	neutral
0	Alright . That's a good idea .	happiness
1	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .	neutral
0	Days ?	neutral
1	Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .	neutral

0	Okay , I think that will be all for me today .	happiness

0	I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .	neutral
1	Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .	neutral
0	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .	surprise
1	Do you sell direct to shops ?	neutral
0	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .	neutral
1	Do you keep a stock of these things ?	neutral
0	In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .	neutral
1	That is , your commission .	neutral
0	Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .	neutral
1	Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .	neutral
0	The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .	neutral
1	According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?	neutral
0	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .	neutral
1	We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...	neutral
0	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?	neutral
1	Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .	neutral

0	I have some medicine at home that I could take .	neutral
1	Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?	neutral
0	Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .	neutral

1	It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .	sadness

0	We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .	neutral
1	Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .	neutral
0	Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?	neutral
1	This is already our best price .	neutral
0	But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .	neutral
1	Well , what would you suggest ?	neutral
0	Could you make it $ 4500 ?	neutral
1	I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .	neutral
0	Can we meet each other half way ?	neutral
1	What do you mean ?	neutral
0	Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?	neutral
1	You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .	neutral

1	It's 486 yuan .	neutral

0	Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?	neutral
1	As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .	neutral
0	Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .	neutral
1	So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .	neutral
0	The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?	neutral
1	To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .	neutral
0	That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .	neutral
1	I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .	neutral
0	Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?	neutral
1	Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?	neutral

0	How long will it take us to get there ?	neutral
1	I think about ten minutes by bus .	neutral

1	I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .	neutral
0	Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .	neutral
1	I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?	neutral

1	Ok .	neutral
0	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?	neutral
1	Yes .	neutral

1	I'm afraid so , yes .	neutral
0	Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?	neutral
1	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .	neutral
0	What do you recommend we do ?	neutral

0	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .	neutral

0	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	neutral
1	You should go to the dentist .	neutral
0	I hate dentists .	neutral
1	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	neutral
0	It always hurts . I hate going .	neutral
1	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	neutral
0	O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .	neutral
1	Good . You'll feel better after you do .	neutral

0	Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .	neutral
1	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .	neutral
0	How long does it take to get there ?	neutral
1	About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .	neutral
0	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !	neutral
1	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .	neutral

0	I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .	neutral
1	A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?	neutral
0	The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .	neutral
1	So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?	neutral
0	It sounds like it will be .	neutral
1	I really hope it doesn't get cold .	neutral
0	That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .	neutral
1	The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .	neutral
0	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .	neutral
1	It would be nice if the weather would never change .	neutral
0	That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .	neutral
1	True . Predictable weather would make life easier .	neutral

0	Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .	neutral
1	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .	neutral
0	Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	neutral
1	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	neutral
0	I doubt that .	neutral

0	Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	neutral
1	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	neutral
0	You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .	neutral
1	What's special about these things ?	neutral
0	Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	neutral
1	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .	happiness

0	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .	sadness
1	You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .	neutral
0	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .	sadness
1	Is that so ?	surprise
0	Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .	neutral
1	Have you decided ?	neutral
0	Yes . I want to get a better job .	neutral
1	Could you tell me why you want to quit ?	neutral
0	I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .	neutral
1	Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?	neutral
0	I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .	neutral
1	OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .	neutral
0	Thank you so much for your advice .	neutral
1	And every best wish for your new job .	neutral
0	Thank you .	neutral

0	The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?	neutral

0	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .	neutral
1	Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .	neutral
0	All right .	neutral

0	So , how should we get to the theatre ?	neutral
1	Let's take the bus .	neutral
0	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .	anger
1	It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .	neutral
0	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .	anger
1	We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .	neutral
0	Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .	neutral
1	If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?	neutral
0	We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .	neutral
1	I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .	neutral
0	Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .	neutral
1	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .	neutral
0	Thanks , that was nice of you .	happiness
1	See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !	neutral

0	Let's go over this plan again .	neutral
1	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .	neutral
0	And that is mostly flat , right ?	neutral
1	Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .	neutral
0	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?	neutral
1	That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .	neutral
0	It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .	neutral
1	Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?	neutral

0	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?	neutral
1	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .	anger
0	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .	neutral
1	Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .	neutral
0	No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .	neutral
1	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .	neutral
0	Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .	neutral

0	It's time for bed .	neutral
1	I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .	neutral
0	It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .	neutral
1	I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .	neutral
0	Why don't you try counting sheep ?	neutral
1	I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .	neutral
0	That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .	neutral
1	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?	neutral
0	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .	neutral
1	I promise I'll go to sleep soon .	neutral
0	No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .	neutral
1	See you in the morning .	happiness

0	I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .	neutral
1	How about your psychological resilience ?	neutral
0	I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .	neutral
1	How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?	neutral

0	Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?	neutral
1	Is it possible to change to another room ?	neutral
0	Could you please tell me why ?	neutral
1	My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .	neutral

0	Your license plate was caught on camera ?	neutral
1	A picture of my license plate was never taken .	neutral

1	Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .	neutral
0	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .	neutral
1	That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .	neutral
0	What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?	neutral
1	Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .	neutral
0	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?	neutral
1	Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .	neutral
0	Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .	neutral
1	After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .	neutral

0	what shall we do after the volleyball match ?	neutral

1	They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .	neutral

0	Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .	neutral
1	OK , what does that entail ?	neutral
0	It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .	neutral
1	Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?	neutral
0	Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .	neutral
1	I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?	happiness

0	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?	happiness
1	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .	neutral
0	So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?	neutral
1	Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .	neutral
0	How long did it take you to do the tiling .	neutral
1	As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .	neutral
0	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?	happiness

0	I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .	neutral
1	We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .	neutral
0	Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .	neutral
1	I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .	neutral
0	I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .	neutral
1	But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .	neutral
0	I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .	neutral
1	There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .	neutral
0	Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .	neutral

0	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .	neutral
1	The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .	neutral
0	Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .	neutral
1	When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .	neutral
0	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?	neutral
1	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .	neutral
0	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?	neutral
1	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet .

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .	neutral
1	I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest .

1	Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .	neutral
0	What gift ?	neutral
1	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .	neutral
0	You refused the gift ? That's terrible .	surprise
1	I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .	neutral
0	Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .	neutral
1	That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .	neutral

0	I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .	neutral

1	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	neutral
0	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	neutral
1	Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .	neutral
0	I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	neutral
1	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	happiness
0	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	neutral

0	Yes , this waitress did a great job .	neutral
1	OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .	neutral
0	What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?	neutral
1	Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?	neutral
0	Yes , 20 % would be perfect .	neutral
1	Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .	neutral
0	Yes , that was one fantastic meal !	happiness
1	I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .	happiness

0	Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?	neutral
1	Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .	neutral
0	Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?	neutral

0	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !	anger
1	What ? What did you buy ?	neutral
0	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !	anger
1	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?	neutral
0	There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .	neutral
1	And ?	neutral
0	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .	neutral
1	And it's a brick ?	neutral
0	Yes .	neutral
1	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?	neutral
0	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .	neutral
1	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .	neutral
0	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .	neutral
1	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?	neutral
0	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .	neutral
1	Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !	neutral
0	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .	neutral
1	That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .	neutral
0	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?	neutral

0	Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?	neutral
1	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .	neutral

1	Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .	neutral
0	So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .	neutral
1	How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?	neutral
0	I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .	neutral
1	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .	neutral
0	I think that we should leave 10 % .	neutral
1	$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .	neutral

0	Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .	neutral
1	Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .	neutral
0	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !	surprise
1	Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .	neutral

0	Would you care for a drink ?	neutral
1	No , thanks . I'm fine .	neutral

0	What do you suggest ?	neutral
1	The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .	neutral

0	Well .	neutral
1	I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .	neutral
0	You mean you want to run the meetings ?	neutral
1	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .	neutral
0	Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .	neutral
1	I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .	neutral
0	I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .	neutral

1	I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .	neutral
0	But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .	neutral
1	Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .	neutral
0	But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .	neutral
1	A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .	neutral
0	Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .	neutral
1	Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .	neutral
0	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .	anger
1	Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .	neutral

0	There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .	neutral
1	Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .	neutral
0	I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .	neutral
1	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .	neutral
0	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .	neutral
1	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .	neutral

0	Ahhchooo !	neutral
1	You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?	neutral
0	No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .	neutral

0	Consider yourself lucky .	neutral
1	What are all the symptoms ?	neutral
0	Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .	neutral
1	That doesn't sound good .	neutral
0	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?	neutral
1	Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .	neutral
0	Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .	neutral
1	I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .	neutral
0	That's pretty bad .	neutral
1	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .	happiness

0	I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?	neutral
1	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .	neutral
0	Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .	neutral
1	What about cats ? They are more independent .	neutral
0	Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .	neutral
1	How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?	neutral

1	No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .	neutral
0	I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .	neutral
1	So , we'd like to see some embroidery .	neutral

0	Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?	neutral
1	I had some bread for breakfast .	neutral
0	Let's go out for brunch .	neutral
1	Brunch ?	neutral
0	It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .	neutral
1	Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .	neutral

1	Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .	neutral
0	Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?	neutral

1	We need to find a good realtor .	neutral
0	Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .	neutral

1	But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .	neutral
0	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .	neutral
1	I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has	neutral

1	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?	neutral
0	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .	neutral
1	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?	neutral
0	Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .	neutral
1	Why ?	surprise
0	Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .	neutral
1	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .	neutral
0	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .	neutral
1	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .	neutral

0	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...	neutral
1	We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	neutral
0	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .	neutral
